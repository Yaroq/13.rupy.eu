                  Theo Hultberg is Chief Architect at Burt, a Göteborg based big data startup that wants to revolutionize the advertising industry by showing that there's more to ad analytics than clicks. He’s the co-organizer of his local Ruby, Scala, and distributed systems user groups, but his only claim to fame is that he has more reputation on Stack Overflow than Jeff and Joel combined.
